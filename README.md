# CLM Configuration Samples

This repository contains examples of how to use the CLM Platform Configuration APIs.

There are two samples:

- **[Tutorials](tutorial/README.md)** bite-size examples that walk you through the use of each of the CLM Platform APIs.

- **[iHear](tutorial/README.md)** larger app that mimics a webshop selling hearing aids.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the examples, you need to:

- Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- Have an installation of **CLM Platform** running.
- Have the iHear sample package published to the storage. Refer to the CLM Platform documentation for instructions on how to do that.

The samples are web applications built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), and the code and documentation requires that you are familiar with writing web application with React.

The `iHear` sample is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and assumes that you have a minimal understanding of TypeScript.
