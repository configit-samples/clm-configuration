# CLM Configuration Samples

This repository contains sample applications that show how to use the CLM Platform Configuration API.

There are two samples:

- **[Basic](basics/README.md)** - A basic application that demonstrates each of the Configuration API endpoints.

- **[iHear](ihear/README.md)** - A larger application that mimics a webshop selling hearing aids.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the examples, you need to:

- Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- Have an installation of **CLM Platform** running.
- Have the iHear sample package published to the storage. Refer to the CLM Platform documentation for instructions on how to do that.

To follow along with the samples, you need to be familiar with building web apps with [React](https://reactjs.org/). For the `iHear` sample you also need a minimal understanding of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
